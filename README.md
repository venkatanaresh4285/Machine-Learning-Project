# Student Performance Prediction:

### 1.Problem Statement 
  This project understands how the student’s performance (test scores) is affected by other variables such as Gender, Ethnicity, Parental level of education, and Lunch and Test preparation course.This project focuses on evaluating students capabilities in various subjects using a classification task.Data classification has many approaches, and the decision tree method and probabilistic classification method are utilized here.

## 2.Exploratory Data Analysis
Perform the EDA for the Student Performance Data Set so that I check if there is any null  Values,Duplicates and Statistics Of the Data Like mean,median and mode.After all these I converted all the tabular data columns into visual forms like PieChart,Histplot,Barchart using Matplotlib,Seaborn

## 3.Model Training
  I have train the model by choosing an Independent Variable x and Dependent Variable y
  and created evaluation function for training the model.

## 4.Model Selection
This is used to select the best model of all of the regression algorithms. In linear regression, I got 88.03 curacy in all of the regression models that’s why we choose model.

## Conclusion:
1.Identification of student performance prediction is important for many institutions.
2.Linear regression gives better accuracy compared to other regression problems.
3.Linear regression is the best fit for the problem
4.Linear regression provides an accuracy of 88%, giving out the most accurate results.
